# Task-3--Energy-Monitoring-System-Status-Prediction-using-DecisionTreeClassifier-
This project uses a Decision Tree classifier to predict the status of an energy monitoring system. The statuses are categorized into three classes: Risk, Normal, and NoLoad. The prediction model is trained using demographic and behavioral data of the energy usage patterns.

Project Overview
Energy monitoring systems are crucial for maintaining the efficient and safe operation of electrical systems. This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts the status of an energy monitoring system based on input features derived from user data. The model helps in identifying potential risks, ensuring normal operation, and detecting no-load conditions.
